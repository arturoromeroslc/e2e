# CDK Infrastructure as Code

## Magic

- Build AWS Infrastructure with code

## We will use TS

- Create a Lambda function
- A SNS (Simple Notification Service) Topic
- A CloudWatch Event to execute our Lambda at fixed rates
- A CloudWatch Metric for our Lambda to fire metrics to
- An Alarm which will go off when we have a failed workflow

ALL IN TYPESCRIPT!
