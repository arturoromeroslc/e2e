# Headless Chrome 101

- Typically when you spin up a browser you get all of the UI, you get url bar, a nice window, your awesome dev tools 🦸🏾.

- In headless mode You have to write a program to control the browser

- You can pass in flag `--headless` in to chrome from the command line to open headless chrome

- --remote-debugging-port=9222

  - This is key, we use the DevTools Protocol and apis to control Chrome and make it do things we want to do.

- What is interesting, is talking to Chrome with Nodejs.

- Automation tools and frameworks like selenium, phantomjs, webdriver.io
