# Evaluation

## Lessons Learned

- Logs
  - Proper logs are paramount when debugging a failed workflow especially at night.
  - Keep tunning your metrics, perhaps running every two minutes doesn't make sense for the System Under Test.

## Future

- Monitoring more useful metrics, Use insight queries in CloudWatch service to get: application weekly pass rate, count of high priority bugs filed, critical bug capture rate.

- Setup up automatic test suites ala [@xstate/test](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/tree/master/packages/xstate-test), implementing visual diffing and add screenshots to S3 to see e2e flow.

- Use the e2e test suite for performance testing on SUT (System Under Test)
