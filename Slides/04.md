# Evaluation

## Lessons Learned

- Logs
  - Proper logs are paramount when debugging a failed workflow at night.
  - Keep tunning your metrics, perhaps running every two minutes doesn't make sense for the System Under Test.

## Future

    - Monitoring more useful metrics, Use insight queries in CloudWatch service to get: application weekly pass rate, count of high priority bugs filed, critical bug capture rate, application e2e test coverage, and number of critical product flows tested.
    - Setup up automatic test suites ala xstate/test, implementing visual diffing. Add dynamic test data.
    - Use an e2e test suite for performance testing on SUT (System Under Test)
